Package: r-cran-rcurl
Architecture: all
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu>
Description: The package allows one to compose general HTTP requests and provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get & post forms, etc. and process the results returned by the Web server.  This provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP/...  connection and the form of the request while providing a higher-level interface than is available just using R socket connections.  Additionally, the underlying implementation is robust and extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads), SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also supports cookies, redirects, authentication, etc.
