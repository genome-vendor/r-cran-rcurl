\title{RCurl - an R package for HTTP requests}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

  The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the communication
  underlying much of the Web and Web services, allowing Web browsers
  to download pages, submit HTML forms, and other applications to
  perform rich distributed computing via Web Services such as SOAP.
  The RCurl package provides an interface to a well-established, 
  general and flexible C library -- libcurl --
  that performs HTTP requests.  We describe the primary functions
  in the R package and the basic computational model exposed via this
  interface. We describe some of the more advanced and flexible features of
  the package and provide some examples.  We contrast it with other
  potential HTTP client packages for R and suggest some potential 
  improvements that could be made in the package.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

In section \ref{HTTPOverview}, we provide an overview of the
Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol.  This helps to illustrate the large
number of facilities one must implement to provide a complete HTTP
client facility.  In section \section \ref{RCurlBasics}, we present
the primary functionality of the RCurl package and illustrate these
with some basic examples.  In section \ref{AdvancedFeatures}, we
describe some of the more advanced features of the package that can be
used to provide more controlled access to the HTTP requests and the
responses.  In the final section, we discuss some alternative
approaches to providing client-side HTTP facilities in R and some
potential improvements to the RCurl package.  The goal of the paper is
to provide a flavor for what the RCurl package can do and how to think
about it when using it to develop Web-based applications in R.  The
paper is not intended to be a complete programmers reference guide.
One should consult the help pages for both RCurl and libcurl for
detailed information about the possible options one can use.


\section{The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol}\label{HTTPOverview}

Almost everyone using the Web in some form will be familiar with the
term `http' that is the most common prefix for web sites.  This stands
for the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol and is represents a language or
protocol by which a Web client and server can converse.  Defined by a
W3 document \cite{HTTPSpec}, it specifies how a client can initiate a
conversation with a Web server, how the two can negotiate the settings
each will use, how the client can request specific documents or
content and how this material is to be transferred.  Ths simplest use
is the most common and involves downloading a file from a Web server.
Let's consider the essentials of what happens when we download the URI
(Uniform Resource Identifier) using a Web browser.

Suppose we were to download the file index.html from the RCurl web
page, i.e.  \url{http://www.omegahat.org/RCurl/index.html}.  Our
client would use TCP/IP to connect to the machine www.omegahat.org
(having first resolved the IP address of the machine corresponding the
name www.omegahat.org). It would attempt to connect on the port 80
which is the default port on which Web servers listen for such
requests.  If the server were listening on a non-standard port, such
as 8080, the request would be
\url{http://www.omegahat.org:8080/RCurl/index.html} and the connection
would be established using that different port.
Assuming the connectin has been made, the client and server
then start their HTTP conversation.
The client writes the basic command to fetch the file
/RCurl/index.html:
\begin{verbatim}
GET /RCurl/index.html HTTP/1.1 
\end{verbatim}
The word GET tells the server what operation is being requested, in
this case the retrieval of a document.  The next part of the command
identifies the document.  And the final part tells the Web server that
the client wishes to communicate using HTTP rather than any other
protocol, and specifically version 1.1 of the protocol rather than
1.0.  This more recent version of the protocol provides enhanced
facilities for the client and server to provide information
controlling the connection between them.

Because we are using the 1.1 protocol, the client must provide
information identifying itself the application in addition to this
basic retrieval instruction.  Specifically, it must identify the
domain of the Web server from which it is requesting the document.
This might seem strange; surely the Web server knows the domain of the
Web server itself.  This is not always the case as a single Web server
can act as a virtual server for many domains.  And so, in version 1.1
of HTTP, the client should indicate the domain of interest.

So the client need only write the following text 
along the socket connecting the client and Web server:
\begin{verbatim}
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.omegahat.org
\end{verbatim}
Both lines are ended with a control-linefeed (\\\\r\\\\n) and the
request is completed by sending a terminating blank-line.  

The Web server is reading the bytes on the socket and then recognizes
the end of the request.  It then processes the request and provides a
response. Each reply has the same basic form.
The first line provides information about the
request.  The last component provides an indication
about the status of the request.
The numbers indicate  success
or failure adn identify particular
reasons for that response.
The next segment of the response
is a collection of name--value pairs
given as 
\begin{verbatim}
name: value
\end{verbatim}
These provide information for the client
telling it how the information 
in the response is encoded.
This segment is terminated by a blank line
and then the data for the response appears
is written to the connection.
The client can then read  this information

\section{RCurl and libcurl}\label{RCurlBasics}

\subsection{The Basic Computational Model}

This describes the basic functions of requesting a URI and submitting
a form.  It describes how we can have a handle that we can reuse
across multiple requests or create one each time.  It discusses the
use of options via the \ldots mechanism to set libcurl options within
a call or persistently within a libcurl handle that apply to all
requests using that handle.
